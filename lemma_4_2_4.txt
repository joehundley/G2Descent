# the built in LiE function W_rt_action gives the matrix for w0 acting on the root lattice. 
# Since E8 is self-dual with compatible numbering, the action on the coroot lattice is given by the same matrix.

# we would normally use inverse because W_rt_action is set up for a right action on row vectors, 
# but in this case it's not relevant, because w0 is its own inverse.
